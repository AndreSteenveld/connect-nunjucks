# connect-nunjucks

this middleware is based on the [browser-sync-nunjucks](https://github.com/pkyeck/browser-sync-nunjucks) package.

[nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) works with expressjs out of the box, but we wanted to use the module as a middleware for [browser-sync](http://www.browsersync.io/) - so here you go.
